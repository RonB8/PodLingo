/**
 * Looks up each word's CEFR difficulty level from the bundled Oxford 3000/5000 word lists
 * (assets/oxford_word_levels.txt, generated from the source PDFs in Oxford/). Words absent from
 * those lists are treated as harder than any listed word - not being common enough to make the
 * Oxford lists is itself a difficulty signal.
 *
 * The lists only hold dictionary headwords ("member", "vote"), but a transcript speaks inflected
 * surface forms ("members", "voted"). A literal-only lookup would misclassify those as unranked
 * (hardest) even though their base form is elementary, so a miss falls through [EnglishStemmer]'s
 * base-form candidates before giving up.
 *
 * That still isn't enough for closed-class words: the bundled list omits "the" outright, and
 * omits every irregular form of "be"/"do"/"have" ("is", "was", "been", "does", "had", ...) - no
 * suffix stemmer can derive those from their headword either, since they're irregular rather than
 * inflected. Left unhandled, the single most common words in English would rank as the hardest
 * ones in a sentence. [ElementaryFunctionWords] short-circuits that closed, finite set to the
 * easiest rank before either lookup runs.
 *
 * The same "irregular, not inflected" gap applies beyond that closed set: an irregular verb's
 * past tense/participle ("gone", "went", "seen", "took") doesn't share a stem with its base form,
 * so [EnglishStemmer] can't derive it either. [IrregularVerbForms] is tried as a last resort,
 * after the literal lookup and the stemmer's candidates have both missed, mapping the inflected
 * spelling to its base form and ranking by that base form's Oxford level.
