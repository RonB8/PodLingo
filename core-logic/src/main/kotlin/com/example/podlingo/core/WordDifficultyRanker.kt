/**

object WordDifficultyRanker {

    /**
     * [rankOf] returns a word's difficulty rank; lower is easier, and callers should give
     * unrecognized words the highest rank (per the difficulty source's own contract that "not
     * found" means hardest). [isKnownWord] reports whether the word is in the difficulty source's
     * vocabulary at all - see below. Words with fewer than two letters are dropped: that covers
     * stray punctuation tokens as well as single-letter tokens ("e", "o") that transcription
     * artifacts occasionally produce - too little content to meaningfully translate, and not worth
     * scoring as "hardest" just because a one-letter token is never in the Oxford lists. Genuine
     * one-letter words ("a", "I") are always elementary anyway, so dropping them from the
     * candidate pool never changes which word would have been picked as hardest.
     * Ties keep their original sentence order.
     *
     * Names are never eligible: a proper noun is almost never in the Oxford lists, so it would
     * otherwise dominate [rankOf]'s "unknown = hardest" tier and get picked constantly even though
     * translating a name isn't useful for a learner. A word is treated as a name and dropped from
     * consideration entirely when it's capitalized *and* unrecognized - sentence position isn't a
     * reliable enough signal on its own, since transcripts are chunked into segments at pause
     * points rather than true sentence boundaries, so a name can end up "sentence-initial" purely
     * by where the transcription happened to split. A capitalized *known* word (e.g. "The" opening
     * a sentence) stays eligible either way, since being in the vocabulary at all means ordinary
     * capitalization - not name-ness - is what's going on.
